","body":"## Hi, I'm Sneha!\r\nI think my tagline is a fair introduction, isn't it? \\*wink\\*\r\n\r\nIf you've read The Magician's Nephew by C.S.Lewis, you will remember the Wood between the Worlds, a quiet forest dotted with pools which serve as portals to different places of the magical world of Narnia. Digory and Polly used magic rings and travelled across Aslan's country through these pools. Well, this page is MY Wood between the Worlds! But don't linger here for too long, it is uninhabited and will cause magically induced amnesia and sleepiness. \\*wink again\\*\r\n\r\n![The Wood](http://i.imgur.com/mOwu8SU.jpg)\r\n\r\n\"It was a rich place: as rich as plum cake.\" - Digory, *The Magician's Nephew*  \r\n\r\n### I design. Sometimes.\r\n![Design](http://i.imgur.com/TQ2v9aX.png)\r\nI love making posters and banners and coming up with beautiful color schemes and typefaces. I'm getting some experience in Adobe Illustrator, and am creating some fonts of my own! Have a look at my design [here](https://snehananavati.carbonmade.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
