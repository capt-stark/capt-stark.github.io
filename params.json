","body":"## Hi, I'm Sneha!\r\nI think my tagline is a fair introduction, isn't it? \\*wink\\*\r\n\r\nIf you've read The Magician's Nephew by C.S.Lewis, you will remember the Wood between the Worlds, a quiet forest dotted with pools which serve as portals to different places of the magical world of Narnia. Digory and Polly used magic rings and travelled across Aslan's country through these pools. Well, this page is MY Wood between the Worlds! But don't linger here for too long, it is uninhabited and will cause magically induced amnesia and sleepiness. \\*wink again\\*\r\n\r\n![The Wood](http://i.imgur.com/mOwu8SU.jpg)\r\n\r\n\"It was a rich place: as rich as plum cake.\" - Digory, *The Magician's Nephew*  \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n#### I design. Often.\r\n![Design](http://i.imgur.com/TQ2v9aXm.png)\r\n\r\nI love making posters and banners and coming up with beautiful color schemes and typefaces. I'm getting some experience in Adobe Illustrator, and am creating some fonts of my own! Have a look at my design [here](https://snehananavati.carbonmade.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### I blog. Occasionally.\r\n![Blog](http://i.imgur.com/MRGRS2fm.png)\r\n\r\nSometimes, it's about Anonymous, the hacker organisation. Sometimes about a teddy bear. Somtimes about how music is enriching for the soul, and sometimes about poetry. Take a look [here](https://starsandinfinity.wordpress.com/)!\r\n\r\n#### I am on YouTube. A lot!\r\n![YouTube](http://i.imgur.com/MLq87eBm.png)\r\n\r\nI love watching TED talks, educational videos to help me out with my coursework, videos on cooking, life hacks and listen to a lot of music. Personal favourites are the Coke Studio and ... Taylor Swift! Follow me [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/astrostorm96)!\r\n\r\n#### I write at Campus Diaries. It's fun!\r\n![CD](http://i.imgur.com/3tbX8e3m.png)\r\n\r\nCampus Diaries are an amazing place to write and share stories. Popular across most colleges in the country, they organize events like Spoken Word Poetry and Airplane Poetry movement. Having interned there, I love the literary culture that they bring to college-goers across the country.
