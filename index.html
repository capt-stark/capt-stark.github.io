<p>I think my tagline is a fair introduction, isn't it? *wink*</p>

<p>If you've read The Magician's Nephew by C.S.Lewis, you will remember the Wood between the Worlds, a quiet forest dotted with pools which serve as portals to different places of the magical world of Narnia. Digory and Polly used magic rings and travelled across Aslan's country through these pools. Well, this page is MY Wood between the Worlds! But don't linger here for too long, it is uninhabited and will cause magically induced amnesia and sleepiness. *wink again*</p>

<p>"It was a rich place: as rich as plum cake." - Digory, <em>The Magician's Nephew</em>  </p>

I love making posters and banners and coming up with beautiful color schemes and typefaces. I'm getting some experience in Adobe Illustrator, and am creating some fonts of my own! Have a look at my design <a href="https://snehananavati.carbonmade.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
