<a id="hi-im-sneha" class="anchor" href="#hi-im-sneha" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hi, I'm Sneha!</h2>

<p>I think my tagline is a fair introduction, isn't it? *wink*</p>

<p>If you've read The Magician's Nephew by C.S.Lewis, you will remember the Wood between the Worlds, a quiet forest dotted with pools which serve as portals to different places of the magical world of Narnia. Digory and Polly used magic rings and travelled across Aslan's country through these pools. Well, this page is MY Wood between the Worlds! But don't linger here for too long, it is uninhabited and will cause magically induced amnesia and sleepiness. *wink again*</p>

<p>"It was a rich place: as rich as plum cake." - Digory, <em>The Magician's Nephew</em>  </p>

<a id="i-design-often" class="anchor" href="#i-design-often" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I design. Often.</h4>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/TQ2v9aXm.png" alt="Design"></p>

<p>I love making posters and banners and coming up with beautiful color schemes and typefaces. I'm getting some experience in Adobe Illustrator, and am creating some fonts of my own! Have a look at my design <a href="https://snehananavati.carbonmade.com/">here</a>.</p>

<a id="i-blog-occasionally" class="anchor" href="#i-blog-occasionally" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I blog. Occasionally.</h4>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/MRGRS2fm.png" alt="Blog"></p>

<p>Sometimes, it's about Anonymous, the hacker organisation. Sometimes about a teddy bear. Somtimes about how music is enriching for the soul, and sometimes about poetry. Take a look <a href="https://starsandinfinity.wordpress.com/">here</a>!</p>

<a id="i-am-on-youtube-a-lot" class="anchor" href="#i-am-on-youtube-a-lot" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I am on YouTube. A lot!</h4>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/MLq87eBm.png" alt="YouTube"></p>

<p>I love watching TED talks, educational videos to help me out with my coursework, videos on cooking, life hacks and listen to a lot of music. Personal favourites are the Coke Studio and ... Taylor Swift! Follow me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/astrostorm96">here</a>!</p>

<a id="i-write-at-campus-diaries-its-fun" class="anchor" href="#i-write-at-campus-diaries-its-fun" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I write at Campus Diaries. It's fun!</h4>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3tbX8e3m.png" alt="CD"></p>

<p>Campus Diaries are an amazing place to write and share stories. Popular across most colleges in the country, they organize events like Spoken Word Poetry and Airplane Poetry movement. Having interned there, I love the literary culture that they bring to college-goers across the country. Read my stories and articles <a href="https://campusdiaries.com/sneha.nanavati">here</a>.</p>

<a id="i-tweet-quite-a-lot-apparently" class="anchor" href="#i-tweet-quite-a-lot-apparently" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I tweet! Quite a lot, apparently.</h4>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2t2Z31Jm.png" alt="Twitter"></p>

<p>From MUN updates to Cucumebrpatch retweets, from talking about my TV shows to supporting my football club, I tweet about everything. Follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/thenanavatigirl">here</a>. </p>

<a id="theres-more-to-come" class="anchor" href="#theres-more-to-come" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>There's more to come.</h4>

<p>I'd like to update my technical profile and resume, too, but I'll do that on my college website: (researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~sneha.nanavati) Don't be disappointed if it doesn't work, I'm still building it. I'm also planning on using jekyll to blog on github pages itself. </p>

<p>Thanks for visiting this page!</p>
